# Introduction

- A Solidity tutorial with bottom-up approach
  - Instead of building a project and explaining the elements of the language
  - Explore all the building blocks and later we build something of them
- Not meant to be a 'basics of programming' tutorial. Requires a little knowledge in
  - Programming terms: What is a variable, a function, type, value, what does declaration mean
  - OOP terms: What is a class, what does inheritance mean
  - EVM: Although there will be a little EVM introduction, it will not be that in-depth
