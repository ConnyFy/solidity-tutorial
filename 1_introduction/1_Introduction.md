# Introduction

- A Solidity tutorial with bottom-up approach
  - Instead of building a project and explaining the elements of the language
  - Explore all the building blocks and later we build something with them
- It is not meant to be a 'basics of programming' tutorial and requires a general knowledge in
  - Programming terms: What variables, functions, types are, control flow statements, logical operators
  - OOP terms: What a class is, what inheritance and visibility mean
  - Blockchain & Ethereum: How blockchains work in general, what a smart contract is
  - EVM: Although there will be a little EVM introduction, it won't cover everthing in-depth
