# Installing Solidity Compiler

- I won't cover this here, follow along the [official guideline](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/installing-solidity.html) to install solidity on your machine.
- However, for small contracts the recommended way is to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) that is an online Solidity compiler. I will also you that throughout this tutorial.
- For bigger projects, it is better to use a framework that comes with a lot of utility tools anyway, including a compiler.
